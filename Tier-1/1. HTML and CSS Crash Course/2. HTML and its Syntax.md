# HTML and its Syntax
HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the language to write the content of a website.
Everything in a webpage is written with tags, which are also called HTML elements.

## Syntax
```
<></>
```
<br>
The first tag `<>` is called opening tag, and the next tag `</>` is called closing tag.

## The basic structure of a HTML Document
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

## Explanation of each line
1. **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This is the type declaration of the whole document. It means the version of the HTML Document
2. **`<html></html>`**: The starting point of a website
3. **`<title></title>`**: The title of a website
4. **`<body></body>`**: This is the main content area. What is written inside this tag, will show on the website.
