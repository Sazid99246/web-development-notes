# HTML Lists

Lists are a way to organize our content. In websites, sometimes the contents need to be organized like lists. For that, we have list tags for that. A special use case of list tags is **navigation menu**.

## Types of Lists
In HTML, there are 2 types of Lists: 

1. **Unordered List**: This type of list is written with bullet points. They are also called *Bulleted List*. There is no order maintained to write the list.

For example:

```
<h3>A list of Programming Languages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
```

Output:

<h3>A list of Programming Languages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

2. **Ordered List:** This type of list is written with alphanumeric characters. This is also called *numbered list* sometimes.

For example:

```
<h3>A list of Web Development Jobs</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Frontend Developer</li>
    <li>Backend Developer</li>
    <li>Fullstack Developer</li>
    <li>JavaScript Developer</li>
    <li>Laravel Developer</li>
</ol>
```

Output:

<h3>A list of Web Development Jobs</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Frontend Developer</li>
    <li>Backend Developer</li>
    <li>Fullstack Developer</li>
    <li>JavaScript Developer</li>
    <li>Laravel Developer</li>
</ol>
