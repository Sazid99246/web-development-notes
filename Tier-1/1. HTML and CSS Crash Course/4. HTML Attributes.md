# HTML Attributes
Attributes add some additional features to an HTML element. They refer to the address to a website, or to the address of an image. They also define height, weight of an image. 

## Structure of writing attributes
The attributes are written in the **opening tag** of an element. They are written in a key value pair, differencing with an **equal** sign.

For example:
```HTML
<a href="www.google.com">Google</a>
```
Here, *href* is an attribute.
