# CSS Selectors

CSS Selectors are the items with which we select how to change a content of HTML.

Here are some CSS Selectors

1. **Element Selector:** The HTML Elements can be CSS Selectors. They are the most basic selector in CSS.

Example:
```
p {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

2. **CLass Selector:** Classes are an attribute of HTML element. They are written with a dot(.) or full-stop in css as selectors. A class can be used many times in a page.

Example:

In HTML:
```
<p class="para-1">I am Sazid.</p>
```

In CSS:
```
.para {
    font-size: 36px;
}
```

3. **ID Selector**: IDs are an attribute of HTML elements. They are written with a hashtag(#). An ID can be used only one time in a page.

Example: 

In HTML:
```
<p id="special-para">This is an special paragraph.</p>
```

In CSS:
```
#special-para {
    color: blue;
}
```
