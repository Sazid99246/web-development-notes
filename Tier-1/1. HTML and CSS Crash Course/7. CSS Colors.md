# CSS Colors

Colors in CSS can be defined in many ways:

1. **Color name:** This is the easiest way to define a color in styling. But not all the color can be written as names.

For example:

```
color: goldenrod;
```

2. **HEX**: Another way is to use 6 digits of hexadecimal values(0-9, A-F) with a prefix of *#*.

For example: 

```
color: #1ef6ad;
```

3. **RGB**: RGB is the short form of Red, Green and Blue. In this color format, we have to specify about the colors' values of how much red, green and blue colors needed to get another color. The value of each color will be in between 0 and 255.

For example:

```
color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
```

4. **HSL**: HSL is the short form of Hue, Saturation and lightness. With this color format, we have to specify the hue, saturation and lightness of a color. The value of hue will be in between 0 and 359, saturation and lightness will be 0% and 100%.

For example:

```
color: hsl(300, 50%, 20%);
```
