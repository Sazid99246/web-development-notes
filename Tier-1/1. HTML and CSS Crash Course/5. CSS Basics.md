# CSS Basics
CSS is a stylesheet language by which we style our websites. Every style is called a rule in CSS.

## Structure of CSS
Every CSS rule is written as a key-value pair. The keys are called properties. The property-value pair is separated by a colon (:). There must be a semicolon (;) at the end of each pair.

The format is: *`property: value`*.

## Types of CSS
1. **Inline CSS**: Inline CSS is written in the *style* attribute in a element's opening tag.

For example:

```
<p style="font-size: 20px;"></p>
```

2. **Internal CSS:** Internal CSS is written inside the `<style>` tag inside the `<head> tag`.

For example: 

```
<style>
    p {
        text-aling: center;
    }
</style>
```

3. **External CSS:** External CSS is written in a new file which ends with the extension *.css*. The file will be connected to the html file which includes the contents.
